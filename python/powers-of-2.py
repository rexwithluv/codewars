""" Complete the function that takes a non-negative integer `n` as
input, and returns a list of all the powers of `2` with the exponent
ranging from `0` to `n` ( inclusive ).

## Examples

```python
n = 0  ==> [1]        # [2^0]
n = 1  ==> [1, 2]     # [2^0, 2^1]
n = 2  ==> [1, 2, 4]  # [2^0, 2^1, 2^2]
```
```bf
  n = String.fromCharCode(0)  ==> String.fromCharCode(1)
  n = String.fromCharCode(1)  ==> String.fromCharCode(1) +
  String.fromCharCode(2)
  n = String.fromCharCode(2)  ==> String.fromCharCode(1) +
  String.fromCharCode(2) + String.fromCharCode(4)
```

## Encodings

`purity: LetRec`
`numEncoding: BinaryScott`
export `foldr` for your `List` encoding
~~~

~~~if:riscv
RISC-V: The function signature is:

```c
void powers_of_two(size_t n, uint64_t powers[n + 1]);
```

Write the result to `powers`. You may assume it is large enough to hold
the result. You should not return anything.
~~~
~~~if:bf
- Since BF doesn't have arrays, you should output each element
individually.
- Outputs will always fit within a byte
