Everybody knows the classic ["half your age plus seven"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_disparity_in_sexual_relationships#The_.22half-your-age-plus-seven.22_rule) dating rule that a lot of people follow (including myself). It's the 'recommended' age range in which to date someone.

```minimum age <= your age <= maximum age```

## Task

Given an integer (1 <= n <= 100) representing a person's age, return their minimum and maximum age range.

This equation doesn't work when the age <= 14, so use this equation instead:
```
min = age - 0.10 * age
max = age + 0.10 * age
```
You should floor all your answers so that an integer is given instead of a float (which doesn't represent age). ```Return your answer in the form [min]-[max]```

##Examples:

```
age = 27   =>   20-40
age = 5    =>   4-5
age = 17   =>   15-20
``` */

const datingRange = (age) => {
    let min, max;
    if (age >= 14) {
        min = (age / 2) + 7;
        max = (age - 7) * 2;
    } else {
        min = age - 0.10 * age;
        max = age + 0.10 * age;
    }

    return Math.floor(min) + "-" + Math.floor(max);
}
