Write a function that flattens an `Array` of `Array` objects into a flat `Array`.  Your function must only do one level of flattening.

```javascript
flatten([1,2,3]) // => [1,2,3]
flatten([[1,2,3],["a","b","c"],[1,2,3]])  // => [1,2,3,"a","b","c",1,2,3]
flatten([[[1,2,3]]]) // => [[1,2,3]]
```

```coffeescript
flatten [1,2,3] # => [1,2,3]
flatten [[1,2,3],["a","b","c"],[1,2,3]]  # => [1,2,3,"a","b","c",1,2,3]
flatten [[[1,2,3]]] # => [[1,2,3]]
```

```ruby
flatten [1,2,3] # => [1,2,3]
flatten [[1,2,3],["a","b","c"],[1,2,3]]  # => [1,2,3,"a","b","c",1,2,3]
flatten [[[1,2,3]]] # => [[1,2,3]]
```

```python
flatten [1,2,3] # => [1,2,3]
flatten [[1,2,3],["a","b","c"],[1,2,3]]  # => [1,2,3,"a","b","c",1,2,3]
flatten [[[1,2,3]]] # => [[1,2,3]]
``` */

const flatten = (array) => array.flat();
