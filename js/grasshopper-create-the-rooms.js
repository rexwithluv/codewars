# Escape the room

You are creating an "Escape the room" game. The first step is to create a hash
table called `rooms` that contains all of the rooms of the game. There should
be at least 3 rooms inside it, each being a hash table with at least three
properties (e.g. `name`, `description`, `completed`). */

let rooms = {
    room1: { name: "Living room", description: "A large room.", completed: true },
    room2: { name: "Garden", description: "A beautiful garden", completed: true },
    room3: { name: "Kitchen", description: "A dirty kitchen", completed: false }
}
